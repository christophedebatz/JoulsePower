#Jouse Power#
Joulse Power is a test ASP.NET MVC 4 web app that I created before begin to work for another official project in Thales. It was mainly for having a training in ASP.NET. I already knew the main concepts of C# and VB .NET but only for desktop clients creation (experiences in TR and for the SMEDAR, see my resume). So, it's not complicated to understand. It's simply a Rest facade that ou can call in both XML or JSON output format. It's about contact library.
